Your guess is as good as mine
Weather the storm
Time is money
Throwing caution to the wind
Through thick and thin
The last straw
The elephant in the room
Straight from the horse's mouth
Stealing someone's thunder
Speak of the devil
Run like the wind
Pulling someone's leg
Piece of cake
Once in a blue moon
On the ball
No pain, no gain
Like two peas in a pod
Like riding a bike
Letting the cat out of the bag
Letting someone off the hook
Killing two birds with one stone
It's always darkest before the dawn
It takes two to tango
Hitting the nail on the head
Heard it on the grapevine
He/She is off their rocker
Having your head in the clouds
Going on a wild goose chase
Go down in flames
Giving the benefit of the doubt
Giving someone the cold shoulder
Getting a taste of your own medicine
Getting a second wind
Getting a second wind
Fit as a fiddle
Fit as a fiddle
Feeling under the weather
Every dog has his day
Don't judge a book by its cover
Doing something at the drop of a hat
Devil's advocate
Cutting corners
Costs an arm and a leg
Clouds on the horizon
Caught between a rock and a hard place
By the skin of your teeth
Burning bridges
Biting off more than you can chew
Bite the bullet
Best of both worlds
Beating a dead horse
Beat around the bush
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
Adding insult to injury
A snowball effect
A dime a dozen
A blessing in disguise
