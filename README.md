# Hangman Game
 Creating a hangman game from scratch, with sound effect using pygame. Created in Dec 2019
 This is my first attempt to pygame and my first time to create a game
 There are several resources that I used in creating this for personal use and learning. I do not own them and I do not use the following resources for any monetary purposes, so I'd like to credit to the author. I will also include the link below so that you can go to their website or link:
 - AGENTORANGE font downloaded from dafont.com
 - Scribblenaut PNG file downloaded from stickpng.com
 - Several famous royalty sound effects (commonly used in tiktok or entertainment show)grabbed from a chinese website
